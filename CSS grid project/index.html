            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company i joined. i honestly feel i
            got every penny's worth

            i was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. i've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. i signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! i enrolled shortly thereafter. the next 12
            weaks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, i've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startuo.

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've
         never written a line of code, I needed
          some structure from professionals
          who can help me learn programming
          step by step. I was encouraged to
          enroll by a former student of their
          who can only say wonderful things
          about the program. The entire
          curriculum and staff did not
          disappoint. They were very hands-on
          and I never had to wait long for
          assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was outstanding. It took
          my learning to the next level in a way
          that no tutorial could ever have. In
          fact, I've often referred to it during
          interviews as an example of my
          development experience. it certainly
          helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple
          offers. 100% recommend! "
